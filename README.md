# Assignment Overview #

The goal of this project is to create a GUI builder for Swing interfaces. The following features are to be included:
* It will itself present a graphical user interface.
* The user will select a layout manager.
* When the user adds Swing components, they are immediately laid out according to the current layout manager.
* The user has control over the attributes of the Swing components that have been added.
* The user can add JPanels and select their layout managers.
* If the user defines his own JComponents, they can be incorporated into a GUI being built.
* When the user is finished, there is an option to generate a Java file that constructs the desired interface. The generated Java code should be readable by a human.
* The user will be able to edit the GUI after it has first been generated.
